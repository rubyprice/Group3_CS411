We had looked into using either React or Angular for our frontend and either Django or Flask for our backend. After consideration, we decided to go with React for our frontend framework as we are less familiar with typescript, which Angular was based on. While both Django and Flask are based in Python, we need a backend that supports MySQL databases, so we finalized the decision to use Django.
