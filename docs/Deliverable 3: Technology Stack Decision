We had looked into using either React or Angular for our frontend and either Django or Flask for our backend. After consideration, we decided to go with React for our frontend framework as we are less familiar with typescript, which Angular was based on. Dev had also informed us that react came with a lot more prebuilt components and code which could be very helpful as we continue to build our app. While both Django and Flask are based in Python, Dev had informed us that Django, like React, had more prebuilt components and code that we could use as we continue to build our app, and so we decided to go with Django for our backend. Dev had also recommended React for frontend and Django for backend during labs as well.
