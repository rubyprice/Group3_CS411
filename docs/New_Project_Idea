We plan to create a web app that gives movie recommendations based on the weather conditions at a certain location. The two APIs that we will be using with be the IMDb API and a weather API. For our third party authentication, we plan to use Twitter. For the database we will store previous weather conditions that were returned as well as previous movies that were recommended.
