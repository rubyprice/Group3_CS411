As a logged-in user, I want to see movie recommendations based on the weather conditions at the zip code I entered to be able to find a movie to watch.

To get to this point, the User Login-Logout Story and the Zip Code Story must have been successful. At this point, weather data associated with the entered 
zip code will be pulled and our app will return movies associated with the specific weather condition. The movies will be displayed in a list with the 
titles and images associated with each movie. For example, a user who entered a zip code that has a weather condition of snow will get a list of movies 
associated with snow. This will allow the user to find movies with themes that match the environment at the zip code they entered and have a better movie 
watching experience.

Here are some exceptions to the happy path. One exception is that there are no movies associated with the specific weather condition. In this case, the 
movie list will simply be empty and an empty list will essentially notify the user that there are no movies associated with the specific weather condition. 
Another exception is that there is no image associated with a movie. In this case, there will be a default “image not found” to notify the user that an 
image wasn’t found for the movie. Another exception is that the user doesn’t like any of the movie recommendations. In this case, the user can simply enter 
a different zip code as mentioned in Zip Code Story and possibly get different movie recommendations that they like.
