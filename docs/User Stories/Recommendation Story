User Story: As a logged-in user, I want to get a movie recommendation that matches my mood to enhance my movie-watching experience.

Decsription: After the user is logged in following from user login story, their twitter feed is sent to and analyzed by Watson’s API and specific mood is 
associated with their twitter feed. Right after logging in, the user will see the top 5 movies that match the genre associated with their mood 
at the time. If the user is not logged in the website will not be able to analyze their twitter feed and hence will not be able to return a 
list of movies to watch. We are returning movies that are associated with the user’s mood. For example, a user who has a happy twitter feed 
will receive movies that have a happy genre. This will allow the user to have a better movie watching experience.
