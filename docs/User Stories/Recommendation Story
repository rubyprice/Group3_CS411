User Story: 

As a logged-in user, I want to get a movie recommendation that matches my mood to enhance my movie-watching experience.

Decsription:

After the user is logged in following from user login story, their twitter feed is sent to and analyzed by Watson’s API and specific mood is 
associated with their twitter feed. Right after logging in, the user will see the top 5 movies that match the genre associated with their mood 
at the time. If the user is not logged in the website will not be able to analyze their twitter feed and hence will not be able to return a 
list of movies to watch. We are returning movies that are associated with the user’s mood. For example, a user who has a happy twitter feed 
will receive movies that have a happy genre. This will allow the user to have a better movie watching experience.

This is assuming that the user follows the “happy path”. There can be a couple exceptions to this path. The first being more than one emotion being 
associated with the user’s twitter feed. For example, if the user’s twitter feed is equally happy and sad then we can face this issue by giving the 
user a few movie recommendations each. In other words, out of the 5 movies, 2 can be happy movies while 3 can be sad, or vice versa. This will allow 
the user to have a wider range of choices and will result in a better movie watching experience. The next exception could be if the emotion associated 
with their twitter feed does not match with any movie genre. In that case we can have a pop-up warning message that says “No movies match your current
mood, but here are some highly rated movies” and after they close the pop-up movies that are rated highly can be listed.
