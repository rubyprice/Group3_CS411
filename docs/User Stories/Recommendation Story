User Story: 

As a logged-in user, I want to get a movie recommendations with titles matching the weather of my current location.

Decsription:

After the user is logged in, following from user login story, they will be prompted to enter their zip code, which will be stored in our database. Whenver the user 
opens our app, weather data associated with the zip code will be pulled and our app will return movies with titles containing the words of the specific weather 
at the moment. Right after logging in, the user will see the top 5 movies that match the weather at the time. If the user is not logged in, the website will not be 
able to konw their zip code and hence will not be able to return a list of movies to watch. For example, a user who is currently in an area with snow will get a list
of movies containing the word "snow" in their titles. This will allow the user to find movies with themes that match their environment and have a better movie 
watching experience.

This is assuming that the user follows the “happy path”. There can be a couple exceptions to this path. The first being more than one type of weather for the zip code. 
For example, if the weather of a certain zip code is transitioning from rainy to cloudy, then we can resolve this issue by giving the user a few movie recommendations 
for each type of weather. In other words, out of the 5 movies, 3 can be movies containing the word "rainy" while 2 can contain "cloudy". This will allow 
the user to have a wider range of choices and will result in a better movie watching experience. The next exception could be if no movies containing words of a certain 
weather could be found. In that case we can have a pop-up warning message that says “No movies match your current weather, but here are some highly rated movies”.
After users close the pop-up, movies that are rated highly will be listed.
