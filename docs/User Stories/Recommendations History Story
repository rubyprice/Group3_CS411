As a logged-in user, I want to be able to see movies and Spotify playlists that I was previously recommended in order to keep track of all the movies and 
playlists that have been recommended so far.

To get to this point, the User Login-Logout Story, Zip Code Story, Spotify Playlist Recommendation Story, and Movie Recommendation Story must have been 
successful. At this point, the user should be able to see all the previous movie and playlist recommendations that were given. The most recent 
recommendations will be near the bottom of the list, whereas the oldest recommendations will be near the top of the list. The previous movie 
recommendations will be displayed in the same list and format with the current movie recommendations mentioned in Movie Recommendation Story. The previous 
playlist recommendations will be displayed in the same list and format with the current playlist recommendations mentioned in Spotify Playlist 
Recommendation Story. This will allow users to keep track of all the movies and playlists that have been recommended to them so far. This way if they ever 
want to relisten to a previously recommended playlist or rewatch a previously recommended movie, then they’ll be able to find it again.

Here are some exceptions to the happy path. One exception is that the user doesn’t care about past recommendations. In this case, the user can simply 
scroll quickly to the bottom of the list and see the current recommendations. Another exception is that the user doesn’t have any previous recommendations. 
In this case, the list for the movie recommendations and the list for the playlist recommendations will only contain the current recommendations.
