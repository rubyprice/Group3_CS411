As a logged-in user, I want to see Spotify playlist recommendations based on the weather conditions at the zip code I entered.

To get to this point, the User Login-Logout Story and the Zip Code Story must have been successful. At this point, weather data associated with the entered 
zip code will be pulled and our app will return Spotify playlists associated with the specific weather condition. The playlists will be displayed in a list 
with the titles, images, and links to the playlists. For example, a user who entered a zip code that has a weather condition of snow will get a list of 
playlists associated with snow. This will allow the user to find playlists with themes that match the environment at the zip code they entered and have a 
better listening experience.

Here are some exceptions to the happy path. One exception is that there are no playlists associated with the specific weather condition. In this case, the 
playlist list will simply be empty and an empty list will essentially notify the user that there are no playlists associated with the specific weather 
condition. Another exception is that there is no image associated with a playlist. In this case, there will be a default “image not found” to notify the 
user that an image wasn’t found for the playlist. Another exception is that the user doesn’t like any of the playlist recommendations. In this case, the 
user can simply enter a different zip code as mentioned in Zip Code Story and possibly get different playlist recommendations that they like.
