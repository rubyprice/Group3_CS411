Story: As a user, I want to use login and logout authorization to protect my data.

Details: When first entering our application, the user will enter their Twitter log-in information on our homepage to serve as our user-identification. 
If their username and password are verified by Twitter, then they will be taken to their own personal page within our application. If they are not 
verified, then we will ask them to either try again or make a new Twitter account, and they will not be able to view any movie data. We want to have 
a reliable system of authentication, since we will be accessing information from peopleâ€™s Twitter feeds, which could contain private data. Additionally,
we need to require a log-in mechanism since we want each page to be personalized for each user.
