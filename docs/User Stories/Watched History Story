(Watched History Story) As a user, I want to be able to see which movies I have previously watched in order to keep track of all the movies I have watched so far.
To get to this point, the user must log in successfully. After a user logs in successfully, the twitter info is received, and movies based on Watson's sentiment analysis have been watched but not necessarily reviewed, the user should be able to access a page that displays the movie title, year, and other relevant information sorted by the date it was watched (in descending order). The page should display a maximum of five watched movies at a time, but a button should be visible that loads the next five, or previous five watched movies onto the page. This will allow the user to have a sense of organization and sequential order. Too many movies on the page at once would be too much visual input for the user so breaking them up into increments of five will be more digestible, and also consistent with the format of our other functionalities which also display information in increments of five. There should be no duplicates shown on the page, meaning if a user watches a movie more than one time, the page should only display the information corresponding to the first time the user watched the movie. 
There are bound to be exceptions to the happy path:
If the user tries to login but is unsuccessful, they will be prompted to log in again. If the twitter information is not received, or incorrect data is received, the user should encounter an error message describing the twitter error. . If the Watson information is not received, or incorrect data is received, the user should encounter an error message describing the Watson error
