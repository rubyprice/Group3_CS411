As a user, I want to be able to see which movies I have previously watched in order to keep track of all the movies I have watched so far.

After a user logs in successfully, the  twitter info is received, and movies based on Watson's sentiment analysis have been watched and/or reviewed,
the user should be able to access a page that displaysthe movie title, year, and other relevant information sorted by the date it was watched (in descending order). 

If the user tries to login but is unsuccessful, they will be prompted to log in again. If the twitter information is not received, or incorrect 
data is received, the user should encounter an error message describing the twitter error, and the same goes for the data from the Watson sentiment analysis.
