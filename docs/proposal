Proposal 1: Twitter Feed Movie Recommendation

APIs: Twitter, IMDB, Watson
We plan to use the Twitter, Watson and IMDB API to create a movie recommendation based on the sentiment of a 
personâ€™s Twitter feed. The movie recommendation should be a genre which match the mood or emotions gathered from a person's feed. 
For our third party authentication, we plan to use their Twitter log in. Our database will store the emotions gathered from the 
Watson API alongside the movie genres correlated to each emotion. We will return a list of the best matching movies for the user 
to choose from, along with their corresponding IMDB information.

Proposal 2: Best Restaurant Near Eventbrite Event

APIs: Yelp, Eventbrite
We plan to use the Yelp and Eventbrite API to create a list of restaurant recommendations for specific events on Eventbrite. The user will be 
able to select an event they're attending, and get as a result the best restaurants for the event, with the restaurant rating, proximity,
and hours of operation being considered. We may also make use of GoogleMaps to gauge the distance between the event and the restaurant.
Users will use their Google account for authentication through either Yelp or Eventbrite. Our database will store all the possible 
locations of restaurants within a certain radius of a concert, and will return the highest rated restaurant with the closest proximity 
to the chosen event.
